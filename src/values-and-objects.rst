==================

.. rubric:: Legality Rules

:def_p:`fls_buyaqara7am4`
A :term:`value` is either a :term:`literal` or the result of a computation, that
may be stored in a memory location, and interpreted based on some :term:`type`.

:def_p:`fls_rixdyyc525xp`
Two :term:`[value]s` :term:`overlap` when

* :def_p:`fls_m6ctqq70vcxr`
  Both :term:`[value]s` are the same, or

* :def_p:`fls_s231d18x5eay`
  One :term:`value` is of an :term:`abstract data type` and the other denotes a
  :term:`field` of the same :term:`value`, or

* :def_p:`fls_dfr4yqo93fsn`
  One :term:`value` denotes an :term:`array` and the other denotes an element of
  the same :term:`array`, or

* :def_p:`fls_eoak5mdl6ma`
  Both :term:`[value]s` are elements of the same :term:`array`.

:def_p:`fls_jmwhiz1qrtmy`
An :term:`object` relates a :term:`value` to a :term:`name`, and dictates how
the :term:`value` is initialized and modified.

An :term:`object` is :term:`valid` when it has been :term:`initialized` by all
reachable control flow paths.

.. rubric:: Undefined Behavior

:def_p:`fls_6lg0oaaopc26`
It is undefined behavior to create a :term:`value` from uninitialized memory.

Constant Evaluation
-------------------

.. rubric:: Legality Rules

:term:`Constant evaluation` is the process of computing the result of a
:term:`constant expression`.

A :term:`constant context` is a :term:`construct` that requires a
:term:`constant expression`. The following :term:`[construct]s` are
:term:`[const context]s`:

* The :term:`constant initializer` of a :term:`constant` or an :term:`associated
  constant`.

* The :term:`discriminant initializer` of an :term:`enum variant`.

* The :term:`static initializer` of a :term:`static`.

* The :term:`size operand` of an :term:`array type`.

* The :term:`size operand` of an :term:`array repetition constructor`.

* The :term:`constant argument` for a :term:`constant generic parameter`.

* The :term:`default value` of a :term:`constant generic parameter`.

The following :term:`[expression]s` are :term:`[constant expression]s` as long
as their :term:`[operand]s` and nested expressions are also :term:`[constant
expression]s` allowed in that context:

* :term:`Literal` expressions.

* :term:`[Path expression]s` that resolve to ``const`` items, :term:`[unit
  struct]s`, :term:`const generic` parameters, or :term:`[associated
  constant]s`.

* :term:`[Path expression]s` that resolve to :term:`[function]s` or
  :term:`[tuple struct]s`.

* :term:`[Tuple expression]s`, :term:`[array expression]s` and :term:`[record
  struct constructor]s`.

* :term:`[Range expression]s`.

* :term:`[Closure expression]s`.

* :term:`[Block expression]s` and :term:`[unsafe block expression]s`.

* :term:`[Arithmetic expression]s`, :term:`[lazy boolean expression]s` and
  :term:`[bit expression]s`.

* :term:`[Parenthesized expression]s`.

* :term:`[Assignment expression]s` and :term:`[compound assignment
  expression]s`.

* :term:`[Index expression]s`.

* :term:`[Field access expression]s`.

* :def_p:`fls_tvzv7n3x7w31`
  :term:`[Immutable borrow expression]s`, as long as the borrowed type does not
  contain :term:`interior mutability`.

* :def_p:`fls_w1pyskfvs802`
  :term:`[Dereference expression]s`, as long as the dereferenced type is not a
  :term:`raw pointer type`.

* :def_p:`fls_336kkpg5a23b`
  :term:`[Infinite loop expression]s`, :term:`[while loop expression]s` and
  :term:`[while let loop expression]s`.

* :def_p:`fls_cdzn77d30yyt`
  :term:`[If expression]s`, :term:`[if let expression]s` and :term:`[match
  expression]s`.

* :def_p:`fls_419b57mqqw2z`
  :term:`[Type cast expression]s`, except:

  * Function pointer to address casts.

  * Pointer to address casts.

* :def_p:`fls_lbbit0wkatce`
  :term:`[Call expression]s` and :term:`[method call expression]s`, if the
  callee is a :term:`constant function`.

  * This includes the implicit function introduced by tuple struct and variant
    declarations.

:def_p:`fls_6ozenj9t75jg`
Additionally, :term:`[path expression]s` that resolve to static items are
:term:`[constant expression]s` when used in a :term:`static initializer.`

:def_p:`fls_fxyb7cx9xcvg`
It is a static error to create a mutable reference in a :term:`const context`.

An invocation of the ``panic!()`` macro expands to a :term:`constant expression`
allowed in any :term:`const context` and :term:`constant function`, as long as
it is either invoked without arguments, or with a single string literal that
does not capture formatting arguments.

An invocation of the ``addr_of!()`` macro expands to a :term:`constant
expression` allowed in any :term:`const context` and :term:`constant function`,
subject to the same restrictions as a :term:`shared borrow expression`.

Inside the body of a :term:`constant function`, :term:`[arithmetic
expression]s` that use floating point values are not considered :term:`[constant
expression]s`.

If the evaluation of an expression may result in a value's :term:`destructor` to
be run, the expression is not a :term:`constant expression`.

If an expression results in the invocation of an :term:`associated
trait function`, it is not a constant expression. This includes explicit
:term:`associated trait function` invocations, use of :term:`[arithmetic
operator]s` on non-builtin :term:`[type]s`, which call one of the
:std:`core::ops` :term:`[trait]s`, as well as :term:`[field access expression]s`
and :term:`[method call expression]s` that invoke :std:`core::ops::Deref`.

Within an :term:`explicit enum discriminant`, mentioning a :term:`generic
parameter` of the :term:`enum` is not permitted and shall be reported as a
static error.

Inside an :term:`expression` that denotes the length of an :term:`array type`,
or the length of an :term:`array repeat expression`, operations whose outcome
depends on :term:`[generic parameter]s` are not permitted and shall be reported
as static errors.

Within any :term:`const context`, mentioning any :term:`lifetime parameter`
is not permitted and shall be reported as a static error. Use of ``‘static``
is permitted.

Within a const context, it is permissible to refer to a path whose value is
itself determined by the evaluation of a :term:`constant expression` in a
:term:`const context` (subject to the restrictions specified above).

A static error shall be reported if such path referencing forms a cycle, even if
the cycle does not occur during evaluation.

An implementation shall evaluate every expression in a :term:`const context`
according to the rules laid out in this specification, when the expression's
value is needed.

An implementation shall evaluate the initializer of every :term:`static` and
non-associated :term:`const`, even when the item is unused.

Evaluation of :term:`[constant expression]s` that result in arithmetic overflow
will panic.

If the evaluation of a :term:`constant expression` results in a panic, either
by reaching an invocation of the ``panic!()`` macro, or by invoking one of the
:term:`[built-in panic condition]s`, a static error shall be reported.

.. rubric:: Dynamic Semantics

Expressions used in :term:`[constant context]s` do not have dynamic semantics.
Invocations of :term:`[constant function]s` follow the dynamic semantics of
:term:`non-[constant function]` invocations.
