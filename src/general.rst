Scope
-----

:def_p:`fls_srdq4mota5pr`
This document specifies the form and meaning of programs written in the
programming language Rust, as implemented by the :codeterm:`rustc` compiler
shipped with Ferrocene. It documents the current understanding for the purposes
of compiler validation. As such, given any doubt, it prefers documenting
behavior of :codeterm:`rustc` as included in the associated Ferrocene release
over claiming correctness as a specification.

:def_p:`fls_dv1qish8svc`
This document is made available for contribution and review as it is useful
outside of the Ferrocene effort and can be a place of shared understanding. It
is not intended as a discussion ground for language evolution. It is also not
indented as a document enabling conformance between compilers.

Contribution and review is managed by the Ferrocene project developers.

Conformity
~~~~~~~~~~

.. rubric:: Implementation Requirements

:def_p:`fls_kdyqtnc6loam`
A conforming tool shall:

* :def_p:`fls_ctwsz8sl7lbq`
  Translate and correctly execute legal programs written in Rust, provided that
  they are not so large as to exceed the capacity of the tool,

* :def_p:`fls_bvpekhdaxctq`
  Identify all programs or program units that are so large as to exceed the
  capacity of the tool (or raise an appropriate exception at run time),

* :def_p:`fls_kfs8gsd36d91`
  Identify all programs or program units that contain errors whose detection is
  required by this document,

* :def_p:`fls_k5sozk8jhrmg`
  Supply all language-defined library units required by this document,

* :def_p:`fls_nwx1fdq6b4mg`
  Contain no variations except those explicitly permitted by this document, or
  those that are impossible or impractical to avoid given the tool's execution
  environment,

* :def_p:`fls_n3ypaile1a36`
  Specify all such variations in the manner prescribed by this document.

:def_p:`fls_nnmx2qsu14ft`
The external effect of the execution of a Rust program is defined in terms of
its interactions with its external environment. The following are defined as
external interactions:

* :def_p:`fls_gu3331rmv2ho`
  Any call on an foreign :term:`function`, including any :term:`argument
  operand`\ s passed to it;

* :def_p:`fls_3iekobt8qqi`
  Any result returned or :term:`panic` propagated from a :term:`main function`
  or an exported :term:`function` to an external caller;

* :def_p:`fls_qx9fxf4py0j0`
  The :term:`value`\ s of imported and exported :term:`object`\ s at the time of
  any other interaction with the external environment.

:def_p:`fls_pl0fyjcwslqm`
A tool that conforms to this document shall produce for the execution of a given
Rust program a set of interactions with the external environment whose order and
timing are consistent with the definitions and requirements of this document for
the semantics of the given program.

:def_p:`fls_lkdm0mdghppv`
A tool that conforms to this document shall support each capability required by
the language as specified.

:def_p:`fls_d07x1mbhgpsd`
A tool that conforms to this document may provide additional :term:`attribute`\
s as long as their names are not the same as the names of :term:`built-in
attribute`\ s.

Method of Description and Syntax Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:def_p:`fls_mc4a28do6kcp`
The form of a Rust program is described by means of a context-free syntax
together with context-dependent requirements expressed by narrative rules.

:def_p:`fls_ioyp4wux6skt`
The meaning of a Rust program is described by means of narrative rules defining
both the effects of each construct and the composition rules for constructs.

:def_p:`fls_jsflt7691ye4`
The context-free syntax of Rust is described using a simple variant of the
Backus-Naur form. In particular:

* :def_p:`fls_98fm7z04lq9`
  A ``monospaced`` font is used to denote Rust syntax.

* :def_p:`fls_ceb5a8t6cakr`
  Words in PascalCase font are used to denote a syntactic category, for example:

.. syntax::

   		FloatExponent

* :def_p:`fls_pts29mb5ld68`
  Words in **bold** font are used to indicate literal words and :term:`keyword`\
  s, for example:

.. syntax::

   		$$crate$$
   $$proc_macro_derive$$
   $$Self$$
   $$tt$$

* :def_p:`fls_gqjo5oh7vn3b`
  Characters in **bold** font are used to indicate literal characters and
  literal punctuation, for example:

.. syntax::

   		$$1$$
   $$F$$
   $${$$
   $$&&$$
   $$>>=$$

* :def_p:`fls_1dz634xp8xp5`
  A character preceded by ``\`` (bold reverse solidus) is used to denote an
  :term:`escaped character`, for example:

.. syntax::

   		$$\t$$
   $$\\$$

* :def_p:`fls_pp9vtjlyblrl`
  A prefix followed by ``?`` (question mark) is used to denote an optional
  prefix, for example:

.. syntax::

   		CrateRenaming?

* :def_p:`fls_6e2vd9fvhsmk`
  A prefix followed by ``*`` (asterisk) is used to denote zero or more
  repetitions of the prefix, for example:

.. syntax::

   		OuterAttributeOrDoc*

* :def_p:`fls_4onq0kkrt6qv`
  A prefix followed by ``+`` (plus sign) is used to denote one or more
  repetitions of the prefix, for example:

.. syntax::

   		MacroMatch+

* :def_p:`fls_qu4rsmnq659w`
  A prefix followed by ``L-H`` is used to denote the number of repetitions of
  the prefix within the range from L to H, inclusive. For example:

.. syntax::

   		HexadecimalDigit1-6

* :def_p:`fls_rllu7aksf17e`
  ``[ ]`` (square brackets) indicate any character within, for example:

.. syntax::

   		[$$8$$ $$a$$ $$\r$$ $$:$$]

* :def_p:`fls_blvsfqeevosr`
  ``~[ ]`` (square brackets preceded by tilde) indicate any character except the
  characters within, for example:

.. syntax::

   		~[$$8$$ $$a$$ $$\r$$ $$:$$]

* :def_p:`fls_lwcjq3wzjyvb`
  ``[ - ]`` indicates any character within the specified range, inclusive. For
  example:

.. syntax::

   		[$$a$$-$$f$$]

* :def_p:`fls_v7wd5yk00im6`
  A ``|`` (vertical line) separates alternative items, for example:

.. syntax::

   		$$self$$ | Identifier | $$_$$


* :def_p:`fls_nf8alga8uz6c`
  ``( )`` (parentheses) are used to group items, for example:

.. syntax::

   		($$,$$ ConfigurationPredicate)

:def_p:`fls_u5ryccs9cpex`
Whenever the run-time semantics define certain actions to happen in an arbitrary
order, this means that a tool arranges for these actions to occur in a way that
is equivalent to some sequential order, following the rules that result from
that sequential order. This can happen, for example, if two parameters of a
given call expression have side effects.
