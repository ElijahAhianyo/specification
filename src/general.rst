Conformity of an Implementation with the Standard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:def_p:`fls_99b7xi1bkgih`
`Ada <http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/2xrm/html/RM-1-1-3.html>`_

.. rubric:: Implementation Requirements

:def_p:`fls_kdyqtnc6loam`
A conforming implementation shall:

* :def_p:`fls_ctwsz8sl7lbq`
  Translate and correctly execute legal programs written in Rust, provided that
  they are not so large as to exceed the capacity of the implementation;

* :def_p:`fls_bvpekhdaxctq`
  Identify all programs or program units that are so large as to exceed the
  capacity of the implementation (or raise an appropriate exception at run
  time);

* :def_p:`fls_kfs8gsd36d91`
  Identify all programs or program units that contain errors whose detection is
  required by this document;

* :def_p:`fls_k5sozk8jhrmg`
  Supply all language-defined library units required by this document;

* :def_p:`fls_nwx1fdq6b4mg`
  Contain no variations except those explicitly permitted by this document, or
  those that are impossible or impractical to avoid given the implementation's
  execution environment;

* :def_p:`fls_n3ypaile1a36`
  Specify all such variations in the manner prescribed by this document.

:def_p:`fls_nnmx2qsu14ft`
The external effect of the execution of a Rust program is defined in terms of
its interactions with its external environment. The following are defined as
external interactions:

* :def_p:`fls_ut6o0c4sapj5`
  Any interaction with an external file (**add link to file-related stuff**);

* :def_p:`fls_d5hcu9fgwjlg`
  The execution of certain **???**; which **???** cause external interactions
  are implementation defined.

* :def_p:`fls_gu3331rmv2ho`
  Any call on an foreign function, including any parameters passed to it;

* :def_p:`fls_3iekobt8qqi`
  Any result returned or exception propagated from a main function (**add
  link**) or an exported function (**add link**) to an external caller;

* :def_p:`fls_20naikq663dv`
  Any read or update of an atomic or volatile object (**add link**);

* :def_p:`fls_qx9fxf4py0j0`
  The values of imported and exported objects (**add link**) at the time of any
  other interaction with the external environment.

:def_p:`fls_pl0fyjcwslqm`
A conforming implementation of this document shall produce for the execution of
a given Rust program a set of interactions with the external environment whose
order and timing are consistent with the definitions and requirements of this
document for the semantics of the given program.

:def_p:`fls_lkdm0mdghppv`
An implementation that conforms to this document shall support each capability
required by the core language as specified. In addition, an implementation
that conforms to this document may conform to one or more Specialized Needs
Appendices (or to none). Conformance to a Specialized Needs Appendix means that
each capability required by the Appendix is provided as specified.

:def_p:`fls_d07x1mbhgpsd`
An implementation conforming to this document may provide additional
attributes. However, it shall not provide any attributes having the same
name as an attribute specified in a Specialized Needs Appendix unless the
provided construct is either as specified in the Specialized Needs Appendix
or is more limited in capability than that required by the Appendix. A program
that attempts to use an unsupported capability of an Appendix shall either be
identified by the implementation before run time or shall raise an exception at
run time.

:def_p:`fls_bs8vivw1eq2x`
For an implementation that conforms to this document, the implementation of a
language-defined unit shall abide by all postconditions, type invariants, and
default initial conditions (**use Rust terms**) specified for the unit by this
document.

.. rubric:: Documentation Requirements

:def_p:`fls_yc32udi73nbt`
Certain aspects of the semantics are defined to be either *implementation
defined* or *unspecified*. In such cases, the set of possible effects
is specified, and the implementation may choose any effect in the set.
Implementations shall document their behavior in implementation-defined
situations, but documentation is not required for unspecified situations. The
implementation-defined characteristics are summarized in **???**.

:def_p:`fls_tvcl9ys3hale`
The implementation may choose to document implementation-defined behavior either
by documenting what generally happens  or by providing a mechanism for the user
to determine what happens in a particular case.

.. rubric:: Implementation Advice

:def_p:`fls_jiyb9rua47o6`
**Is this section needed?**

:def_p:`fls_3rl3krm5xyk4`
If an implementation detects the use of an unsupported Specialized Needs
Appendix feature at run time, it should raise **???** if feasible.

:def_p:`fls_gtf7c1qd3xdh`
If an implementation wishes to provide implementation-defined extensions to the
functionality of a language-defined library unit (**use Rust terms**), it should
normally do so by adding conditionally compiled modules to the library unit
(**use the Rust method**).

Method of Description and Syntax Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:def_p:`fls_nhp42wpty5ym`
`Ada <http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/2xrm/html/RM-1-1-4.html>`_

:def_p:`fls_mc4a28do6kcp`
The form of a Rust program is described by means of a context-free syntax
together with context-dependent requirements expressed by narrative rules.

:def_p:`fls_ioyp4wux6skt`
The meaning of a Rust program is described by means of narrative rules defining
both the effects of each construct and the composition rules for constructs.

:def_p:`fls_jsflt7691ye4`
The context-free syntax of Rust is described using a simple variant of the
Backus-Naur form. In particular:

* :def_p:`fls_98fm7z04lq9`
  A ``monospaced`` font is used to denote Rust syntax.

* :def_p:`fls_ceb5a8t6cakr`
  Words in PascalCase font are used to denote a syntactic category, for example:

.. syntax::

   		FloatExponent

* :def_p:`fls_pts29mb5ld68`
  Words in **bold** font are used to indicate literal words and :term:`keyword`\
  s, for example:

.. syntax::

   		$$crate$$
   $$proc_macro_derive$$
   $$Self$$
   $$tt$$

* :def_p:`fls_gqjo5oh7vn3b`
  Characters in **bold** font are used to indicate literal characters and
  literal punctuation, for example:

.. syntax::

   		$$1$$
   $$F$$
   $${$$
   $$&&$$
   $$>>=$$

* :def_p:`fls_1dz634xp8xp5`
  A character preceded by **``\``** (bold reverse solidus) is used to denote
  an :term:`escaped character`, for example:

.. syntax::

   		$$\t$$
   $$\\$$

* :def_p:`fls_pp9vtjlyblrl`
  A prefix followed by ``?`` (question mark) is used to denote an optional
  prefix, for example:

  A prefix followed by ``*`` (asterisk) is used to denote zero or more
  repetitions of the prefix, for example:

.. syntax::

   		OuterAttributeOrDoc*

* :def_p:`fls_4onq0kkrt6qv`
  A prefix followed by ``+`` (plus sign) is used to denote one or more
  repetitions of the prefix, for example:

* :def_p:`fls_rllu7aksf17e`
  ``[ ]`` (square brackets) indicate any character within, for example:

.. syntax::

   		[$$8$$ $$a$$ $$\r$$ $$:$$]

* :def_p:`fls_blvsfqeevosr`
  ``~[ ]`` (square brackets preceded by tilde) indicate any character except the
  characters within, for example:

:def_p:`fls_rwb8nwfj6k9m`
The :term:`separator`\ s, :term:`delimiter`\ s, keywords and :term:`number
literal`\ s are exclusively made of the characters whose code point is between
``0x20`` and ``0x7E``, inclusively. The special characters for which names
are defined in this document (see `2.1. <https://docs.google.com/document/
d/1J_hlwBXahyRtLZTsGl7TrbVYOLy-c1o7xWEoC_Vii7s/edit#bookmark=id.ph8nlbn3tfb4>`_)
belong to the same range. For example, the character ``E`` in the definition
of :syntax:`FloatExponent` is the character whose name is "Latin capital letter
E", not "Greek capital letter epsilon".

:def_p:`fls_l33yonnxam4h`
When this document mentions the conversion of some character or sequence of
characters to uppercase, it means the character or sequence of characters
obtained by using simple upper case mapping, as defined by documents referenced
in Clause 2 of ISO/IEC 10646:2017.

The name of a :term:`syntactic category` is set in a different font,
``LikeThis``.

:def_p:`fls_u5ryccs9cpex`
Whenever the run-time semantics define certain actions to happen in an arbitrary
order, this means that the tool shall arrange for these actions to occur in a
way that is equivalent to some sequential order, following the rules that result
from that sequential order. This can happen, for example, if two parameters of a
given call expression have side effects.

Classification of Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:def_p:`fls_mttjm3ezojd8`

.. rubric:: Implementation Requirements

:def_p:`fls_vt33x8a8equ9`
This document classifies errors into several different categories:

* :def_p:`fls_l48dgoe8lxj6`
  Error that are required to be detected prior to run time by every Rust tool;

:def_p:`fls_jowayqrbuc7i`
These errors correspond to any violation of a rule given in this document, other
than those listed below. In particular, violation of any rule that uses the
terms shall, allowed, permitted, legal, or illegal belongs to this category. Any
program that contains such an error is not a legal Rust program; on the other
hand, the fact that a program is legal does not mean, *per se*, that the program
is free from other forms of error.

:def_p:`fls_18eso3vuknoy`
The rules are further classified as either compile time rules, or post
compilation rules, depending on whether a violation has to be detected at the
time a compilation unit (**Rust term???**) is submitted to the compiler, or may
be postponed until the time a compilation unit is incorporated into a partition
(**Rust term???**) of a program.

* :def_p:`fls_k1kf2l1cenis`
  Errors that are required to be detected at run time by the execution of a
  Rust program;

:def_p:`fls_etgp6hturlzu`
**This paragraph needs triaging.**

:def_p:`fls_vm147e3b2t04`
The corresponding error situations are associated with the names of the
predefined exceptions. Every implementation is required to generate code that
raises the corresponding exception if such an error situation arises during
program execution. If such an error situation is certain to arise in every
execution of a construct, then an implementation is allowed (although not
required) to report this fact at compilation time.

* :def_p:`fls_awcchbsk00v4`
  Bounded errors;

:def_p:`fls_syhj66w9ppsa`
The language rules define certain errors that need not be detected either prior
to or during run time, but if not detected, the range of possible effects shall
be bounded. The errors of this category are called :term:`*bounded errors*.`
The possible effects of a given bounded error are specified for each such error,
but in any case one possible effect of a bounded error is the raising of the
exception **???**.

* :def_p:`fls_l9vjmtugyqgf`
  Erroneous execution.

:def_p:`fls_qgvn7qa8a47w`
In addition to bounded errors, the language rules define certain kinds of errors
as leading to erroneous execution. Like bounded errors, the implementation
need not detect such errors either prior to or during run time. Unlike bounded
errors, there is no language-specified bound on the possible effect of erroneous
execution; the effect is in general not predictable.

.. rubric:: Implementation Permissions

:def_p:`fls_vqrgg1fjrhq9`
An implementation may provide nonstandard modes of operation. Typically these
modes would be selected by a **???** or by a command line switch when the
compiler is invoked. When operating in a nonstandard mode, the implementation
may reject compilation units (**Rust term???**) that do not conform to
additional requirements associated with the mode, such as an excessive number
of warnings or violation of coding style guidelines. Similarly, in a nonstandard
mode, the implementation may apply special optimizations or alternative
algorithms that are only meaningful for programs that satisfy certain criteria
specified by the implementation. In any case, an implementation shall support a
standard mode that conforms to the requirements of this document; in particular,
in the standard mode, all legal compilation units (**Rust term???**) shall be
accepted.
