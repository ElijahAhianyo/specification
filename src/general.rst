Scope
-----

:dp:`fls_srdq4mota5pr`
This document specifies the form and meaning of programs written in the
programming language Rust, as implemented by the :c:`rustc` compiler shipped
with Ferrocene. It documents the current understanding for the purposes of
compiler validation. As such, given any doubt, it prefers documenting behavior
of :c:`rustc` as included in the associated Ferrocene release over claiming
correctness as a specification.

:dp:`fls_dv1qish8svc`
This document is made available for contribution and review as it is useful
outside of the Ferrocene effort and can be a place of shared understanding. It
is not intended as a discussion ground for language evolution. It is also not
indented as a document enabling conformance between compilers.

:dp:`fls_osh9tiwpnsn1`
Contribution and review is managed by the Ferrocene project developers.

Conformity
~~~~~~~~~~

.. rubric:: Implementation Requirements

:dp:`fls_kdyqtnc6loam`
A conforming tool shall:

* :dp:`fls_ctwsz8sl7lbq`
  Translate and correctly execute legal programs written in Rust, provided that
  they are not so large as to exceed the capacity of the tool,

* :dp:`fls_bvpekhdaxctq`
  Identify all programs or program units that are so large as to exceed the
  capacity of the tool (or raise an appropriate exception at run time),

* :dp:`fls_kfs8gsd36d91`
  Identify all programs or program units that contain errors whose detection is
  required by this document,

* :dp:`fls_k5sozk8jhrmg`
  Supply all language-defined library units required by this document,

* :dp:`fls_nwx1fdq6b4mg`
  Contain no variations except those explicitly permitted by this document, or
  those that are impossible or impractical to avoid given the tool's execution
  environment,

* :dp:`fls_n3ypaile1a36`
  Specify all such variations in the manner prescribed by this document.

:dp:`fls_nnmx2qsu14ft`
The external effect of the execution of a Rust program is defined in terms of
its interactions with its external environment. The following are defined as
external interactions:

* :dp:`fls_gu3331rmv2ho`
  Any call on an foreign :t:`function`, including any :t:`[argument operand]s`
  passed to it;

* :dp:`fls_3iekobt8qqi`
  Any result returned or :t:`panic` propagated from a :t:`main function` or an
  exported :t:`function` to an external caller;

* :dp:`fls_qx9fxf4py0j0`
  The :t:`[value]s` of imported and exported :t:`[object]s` at the time of any
  other interaction with the external environment.

:dp:`fls_pl0fyjcwslqm`
A tool that conforms to this document shall produce for the execution of a given
Rust program a set of interactions with the external environment whose order and
timing are consistent with the definitions and requirements of this document for
the semantics of the given program.

:dp:`fls_lkdm0mdghppv`
A tool that conforms to this document shall support each capability required by
the language as specified.

:dp:`fls_d07x1mbhgpsd`
A tool that conforms to this document may provide additional :t:`[attribute]s`
as long as their names are not the same as the names of :t:`[built-in
attribute]s`.

Method of Description and Syntax Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dp:`fls_mc4a28do6kcp`
The form of a Rust program is described by means of a context-free syntax
together with context-dependent requirements expressed by narrative rules.

:dp:`fls_ioyp4wux6skt`
The meaning of a Rust program is described by means of narrative rules defining
both the effects of each construct and the composition rules for constructs.

:dp:`fls_jsflt7691ye4`
The context-free syntax of Rust is described using a simple variant of the
Backus-Naur form. In particular:

* :dp:`fls_98fm7z04lq9`
  A ``monospaced`` font is used to denote Rust syntax.

* :dp:`fls_ceb5a8t6cakr`
  Words in PascalCase font are used to denote a syntactic category, for example:

.. syntax::

   FloatExponent

* :dp:`fls_pts29mb5ld68`
  Words in **bold** font are used to indicate literal words and :t:`[keyword]s`,
  for example:

.. syntax::

   $$crate$$
   $$proc_macro_derive$$
   $$Self$$
   $$tt$$

* :dp:`fls_gqjo5oh7vn3b`
  Characters in **bold** font are used to indicate literal characters and
  literal punctuation, for example:

.. syntax::

   $$1$$
   $$F$$
   $${$$
   $$&&$$
   $$>>=$$

* :dp:`fls_1dz634xp8xp5`
  A character preceded by ``\`` (bold reverse solidus) is used to denote an
  :t:`escaped character`, for example:

.. syntax::

   $$\t$$
   $$\\$$

* :dp:`fls_pp9vtjlyblrl`
  A prefix followed by ``?`` (question mark) is used to denote an optional
  prefix, for example:

.. syntax::

   CrateRenaming?

* :dp:`fls_6e2vd9fvhsmk`
  A prefix followed by ``*`` (asterisk) is used to denote zero or more
  repetitions of the prefix, for example:

.. syntax::

   OuterAttributeOrDoc*

* :dp:`fls_4onq0kkrt6qv`
  A prefix followed by ``+`` (plus sign) is used to denote one or more
  repetitions of the prefix, for example:

.. syntax::

   MacroMatch+

* :dp:`fls_qu4rsmnq659w`
  A prefix followed by ``L-H`` is used to denote the number of repetitions of
  the prefix within the range from L to H, inclusive. For example:

.. syntax::

   HexadecimalDigit1-6

* :dp:`fls_rllu7aksf17e`
  ``[ ]`` (square brackets) indicate any character within, for example:

.. syntax::

   [$$8$$ $$a$$ $$\r$$ $$:$$]

* :dp:`fls_blvsfqeevosr`
  ``~[ ]`` (square brackets preceded by tilde) indicate any character except the
  characters within, for example:

.. syntax::

   ~[$$8$$ $$a$$ $$\r$$ $$:$$]

* :dp:`fls_lwcjq3wzjyvb`
  ``[ - ]`` indicates any character within the specified range, inclusive. For
  example:

.. syntax::

   [$$a$$-$$f$$]

* :dp:`fls_v7wd5yk00im6`
  A ``|`` (vertical line) separates alternative items, for example:

.. syntax::

   $$self$$ | Identifier | $$_$$

* :dp:`fls_nf8alga8uz6c`
  ``( )`` (parentheses) are used to group items, for example:

.. syntax::

   ($$,$$ ConfigurationPredicate)

:dp:`fls_u5ryccs9cpex`
Whenever the run-time semantics define certain actions to happen in an arbitrary
order, this means that a tool arranges for these actions to occur in a way that
is equivalent to some sequential order, following the rules that result from
that sequential order. This can happen, for example, if two parameters of a
given call expression have side effects.

Versioning
----------

:dp:`fls_l80e3kdwnldc`
Ferrocene is a qualified compiler and this is the accompanying language
specification for the qualified version of the compiler. This document will
be updated with each qualification to accurately reflect the behavior of
the compiler qualified under that version of Ferrocene. This specification
corresponds to Ferrocene 1.0.
